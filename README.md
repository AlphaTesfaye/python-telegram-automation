# **How to Scrape CoinMarketCap Data with Python and Telegram**

In this article, we will show you how to scrape cryptocurrency data from CoinMarketCap using Python and Telegram. We will also create a Telegram bot that will send you the latest cryptocurrency prices.

## Prerequisites

To follow along with this tutorial, you will need the following:

- A Telegram account
- A Python development environment
- The following Python libraries:
    - requests
    - bs4
    - telegram

## Scraping CoinMarketCap Data

The first step is to scrape the cryptocurrency data from CoinMarketCap. We can do this using the requests and bs4 libraries.

```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

# Set the URL of the CoinMarketCap homepage
url = "https://coinmarketcap.com/"

# Get the HTML content of the webpage
result = requests.get(url).text

# Parse the HTML content using BeautifulSoup
doc = BeautifulSoup(result, "html.parser")
```

Now that we have the HTML content of the webpage, we can extract the cryptocurrency data. The cryptocurrency data is located in the `tbody` element of the `table` element.

```python
# Get the `tbody` element of the `table` element
tbody = doc.tbody

# Get the `tr` elements of the `tbody` element
trs = tbody.contents

# Create a dictionary to store the cryptocurrency data
prices = {}

# Iterate over the `tr` elements
for tr in trs:
    # Get the `name` and `price` elements of the `tr` element
    name = tr.contents[2].p.string
    price = tr.contents[4].a.string

    # Add the cryptocurrency data to the dictionary
    prices[name] = price
```

Now we have a dictionary of cryptocurrency data. We can use this data to create a Telegram bot that will send you the latest cryptocurrency prices.

## Creating a Telegram Bot

To create a Telegram bot, you will need to create a bot token. You can do this by following the instructions on the [Telegram Bot Documentation ↗](https://core.telegram.org/bots#creating-a-bot).

Once you have created a bot token, you can create a Telegram bot using the `telegram` library.

```python
import telegram

# Set the bot token
bot = telegram.Bot(token="YOUR_BOT_TOKEN")

# Get the chat ID of the user you want to send the message to
chat_id = "@YOUR_CHAT_ID"

# Send a message to the user
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text="Hello, world!")
```

Now that you have created a Telegram bot, you can use it to send you the latest cryptocurrency prices.

## Sending Cryptocurrency Prices to Telegram

To send cryptocurrency prices to Telegram, you can use the following code:

```python
# Get the latest cryptocurrency prices
prices = get_prices()

# Create a message to send to Telegram
message = "Top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap:\n\n"
for name, price in prices.items():
    message += f"{name}: {price}\n"

# Send the message to Telegram
bot.send_message(chat_id=chat_id, text=message)
```

This code will send a message to Telegram with the latest cryptocurrency prices. You can change the message to include more or less information, or you can send the message to a different chat ID.

## Conclusion

In this article, we showed you how to scrape cryptocurrency data from CoinMarketCap using Python and Telegram. We also created a Telegram bot that will send you the latest cryptocurrency prices.

This is just a basic example of what you can do with Python and Telegram. You can use these tools to create a variety of different cryptocurrency bots.
